<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Description</h2>
<p>The flexibility ontology is a use case family ontology describing the flexibility family on three dimensions :
- Flexibility Operations, describes flexbility offer, request and order and their subsequent data. 
- Flexibility Infrastructure, describes infrastructure elements involved in the flexiblity use cases. This extends to the grid topology, building equipements, and imports specific electromobility and renewable infrastructures defined in their respective modules. </p>

<h2 style="color: #21618C; text-decoration: underline;">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The flexibility ontology covers both operations, services providing them and infrastructure components. </li>
<li>The flexbility ontology imports different UCs infrastructures such as those of electromobility (to consider charging stations), renewables (for renewable energy production among prosumres) and local energy communities. Carrefuly consider reviewing them. </li>
