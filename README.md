# Omega-X Ontology Repository

Welcome to the Omega-X Ontology repository! 

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is built to fit multi-level modular ontologies.
It hosts also relevant alignements to external resources (ontologies/standards). 

The tooling section includes automation scripts for various tasks: ontology building, documentation release, semantic validation, data semantization...

The omega-X ontology is defined by two modules: a core ontology for Events and Time Series (ETS) and a domain ontology for Energy Data Set (EDS).

## Utils

- Ontology diagrams can be defined using CHOWLK [diagram.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). A library for specific ontology conceptualisation is available here [CHOWLK Ontology library](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/). To learn more about visual notation specification, see: [CHOWLK Documentation](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html).
