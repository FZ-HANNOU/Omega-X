### SAREF For System
* [**saref4syst:_System_**]( https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/System): 
The class of systems, i.e., systems virtually isolated from the environment, whose behaviour and interactions with the environment are modeled. Systems can be connected to other systems. Connected systems interact in some ways. Systems can also have subsystems. Properties of subsystems somehow contribute to the properties of the supersystem.
* [**saref4syst:_connectedTo_**]( https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/connectedTo): 
Links a system to a system it is connected to. Connected systems interact in some way. The exact meaning of "interact" is defined by sub properties of s4syst:connectedTo. Property s4syst:connectedTo is symmetric. This property can be qualified using class s4syst:Connection, which connects the two systems. If there is a connection between several systems, then one may infer these systems are pairwise connected.
* [**saref4syst:_subSystemOf_**]( https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/subSystemOf): 
Links a system to its super system. Properties of subsystems somehow contribute to the properties of the super system. The exact meaning of "contribute is defined by sub properties of s4syst:subSystemOf. Property s4syst:subSystemOf is transitive.
